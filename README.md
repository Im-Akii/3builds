# One Heist, Two Realities

An asymmetric multiplayer heist built with **React Three Fiber** + **Rapier**, out of nothing but
boxes, cylinders and cones. One player walks the building blind; everyone else can see the
security layer, but each of them is stuck watching a single room.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## The flow

| Route | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | What the game is, and how a run goes. |
| `/rooms` | Create a room (2–4 players) or join with a code. |
| `/room/[code]` | Name gate → lobby → the run. Share this link; anyone who opens it joins. |
| `/play` | Solo sandbox: you drive the thief and can look through all three layers. |

A room fills up, a **ten second countdown** runs, then the roles are drawn:

- **one thief**, first person, starting on the street outside the entrance;
- **everyone else a spectator**, each posted to exactly one room — lobby, security or vault — and
  they cannot leave it. Three spectators covers the building; fewer means blind spots.

The draw is deterministic from a seed on the room record, so every client lands on the same result
the moment the clock hits zero — nothing waits on the host's tab being awake.

Every view carries a **2D floorplan in the top right** with a live dot for the thief. Spectators
also see guards in their own room on it; the thief does not get guard positions.

## The run

1. The thief walks in off the street, through the entrance into the lobby.
2. **Security room** (west, blue door): the keycard is in here, and so is the note with the vault
   code. The thief can pick up the keycard but cannot see the note as anything special — a
   spectator posted to that room has to scan it in Discovery mode, which relays `4712`.
   The **alarm panel** in here can be disabled with `E`, blinding every camera.
3. **Vault room** (east, yellow door — needs the keycard): `E` at the keypad. Without the code
   relayed from a spectator, it refuses.
4. The round door opens: take the contents, walk back out to the street.

Cameras sweep, two guards patrol and give chase once the alarm is up, floor traps hurt, and the
health pack and bandages patch you up. None of that is visible to the thief.

## The three layers

| View | Who | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thief | the thief | A normal facility. No labels, no cones, no traps. |
| Spectator ("Watch") | spectators, solo | Their room as a cutaway: camera cones, the guard, the keypad, the keycard. |
| Discovery | spectators, solo | Same room plus pulsing blips over what nobody has found yet. Click to scan. |

Anything a spectator scans stays tagged for everyone in the Watch layer — found things become
shared knowledge. A room a spectator is *not* posted to stays sealed to them.

## Controls

- `WASD` move, `Shift` run, `E` interact
- Thief: click to look around (pointer lock, falls back to click-drag)
- Spectator: drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, Watch/Discover to switch layer
- Solo only: `1` / `2` / `3` switch view

## How the multiplayer works

The thief's client owns the simulation — physics, guards, detection — and publishes a snapshot
12 times a second (transform, guards, camera yaws, alarm, flags, log). Spectators never step the
physics world; they fold each snapshot back into the same runtime the renderers already read, and
send `discover` messages the other way.

Transports sit behind one small interface (`app/game/net/types.ts`):

- **`server` (default, working now)** — rooms live in the Next server's memory
  (`app/lib/roomStore.ts`, `app/api/rooms/*`); every client holds one server-sent-events stream.
  Any browser, and any device pointed at this machine's address, can join the same room.
- **`spacetime` (module written, client adapter not finished)** — see below.

## SpacetimeDB

The module in `spacetime/src/index.ts` is written for exactly this flow and typechecks
against `spacetimedb@2.10`:

- tables: `game_room`, `player`, `thief_state`, `discovered_item`, `game_event`
- reducers: `create_room`, `join_room`, `leave_room`, `start_run`, `draw_roles`, `publish_world`,
  `discover_item`, `log_event`, `end_run`
- `draw_roles` uses the same seeded shuffle as the web client, so client-side prediction and the
  server agree on who gets to be the thief.

What is **not** done: the browser-side adapter. It needs the `spacetime` CLI (not installed on
this machine) to `spacetime publish` the module and generate bindings, at which point
`createNet()` in `app/game/net/index.ts` returns a `SpacetimeNet` implementing the same six
methods — `connect/createRoom/join/leave/start/send` — mapping each onto the matching reducer and
table subscriptions onto `onMessage`. Nothing else in the app has to change.

      SecurityCameras.tsx sweeping cameras and cones
      Systems.tsx        line of sight, alarm, damage, room tracking, prompts (host only)

      ViewRig.tsx        cameras, controls and per-view lighting
      Minimap.tsx        the 2D floorplan
```

Three rules keep the layers honest:

- **One simulation, many cameras.** Guards, cones, traps and damage behave identically for
  everyone; only what is *drawn* changes.
- **`level.ts` is the single source of truth.** Every marker carries a `room` and a
  `reveal: "spectator" | "discovery"`; `useRoomVisible` is the one place that answers "can this
  client see inside this room".
- **Nothing spectator-only is ever mounted in a thief client** — not the cones, not the labels,
  not the minimap's guard dots.
